<H2>Live-CD (MixOnCD)</H2>

This is the description of how to boot the CD, find your Mix' IP address and how to log in
to it.

<H3>Booting</H3>

<P>Before inserting the CD, please make sure the BIOS of your computer is configured to boot from CD and the CD is the first device in the boot order. Consult your computer or motherboard manual for further details.</P>

<P>The Live-CD should boot automatically when you turn on your PC. If booting fails, choose one of the
different debug options from the start menu. You can now switch to the logging console by typing
<I>CTRL+ALT+F2</I> to see if the mix has started properly. You can switch to other consoles via <I>CTRL+ALT+Fx</I>.</P>

<H3>IP addresses and ports</H3>
After booting, the mix will tell you its IP address. You may need this information to
tell it to operators of previous mixes, so that they can configure their mixes connect to
your ones. If the local area IP address of your mix differs from the one it has in the
internet (outside), please make sure to tell them only the address that is seen in the
internet (outside). Your mix will warn you about this and tell you the difference. If this
is the case, you may also have to configure your network router to forward the ports used
by your mix to the computer running the mix. Please consult the manual for your router for
further details.


<h3>Local login</h3>
Once your mix has started, a login dialog is presented. You may now type the username
and password of the user you wish to log in. If you did not specify any password in the
MixOnCD configuration, just type <I>root</I>.

<h3>Remote login</h3>
If you specified any password in the MixOnCD configuration, you may login to your mix
via network. Open a unix shell, type
<blockquote>
	<code>
	ssh username@IPADDRESS_OF_MIX
	</code>
</blockquote>
and replace <I>username</I> either by "root" or "mix". You will be asked for the password
you have entered in the configuration. If you did not define a password before, no remote
login is possible for security reasons.
