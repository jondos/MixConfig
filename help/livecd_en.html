<H2>Live-CD (MixOnCD)</H2>

<P>The Mix Configuration Live-CD is an experimental runtime environment for mixes. You won't need to install anything
on your harddisk to use it.
 <I>Right now, this feature is not available for the public due to debugging processes. Therefore you should not 
activate it.</I></P>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Use bootable MixOnCD to create and install the mix (yes/no)</B><BR>	
  This prepares the mix configuration for MixOnCD usage; this configuration won't work with a harddisk installation
  any longer (but you may switch back whenever you want).
  </LI>
  <LI><B>Local Network Settings</B><BR>
