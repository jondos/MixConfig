<H2>Own Certificates Panel</H2>
This panel contains your private MIX certificates. These certificates are used to sign
information sent by your MIX. Without them, no one will trust your mix' messages and no
one will be able to connect to your mix. To prove that you are trustworthy, you will also
have to let an accepted certificate authority, like the <em>JAP Team</em>
(<a href="mailto:jap@inf.tu-dresden.de">jap@inf.tu-dresden.de</a>), sign your certificates.

<P>If you want to connect to other MIXes in a cascade, and other MIXes in the cascade
	should be able to connect to you, you will have to send your public certificates to
	those neighbour mixes. If you do this, please verify if the other mixes have received
	the right certificates by comparing your certificates' hash values with the hash values
	of the certificates your communication partners have received.</P>

<P>It is recommended to protect your private certificates with a password.</P>

<h3>General Certificate Options</h3>
<UL>
  <LI><B>Import</B><BR>
	This option allows you to import private certificates that contain both your
	private key for signing and the corresponding public key for verifying your
	signatures, or a public certificate that fits to your private one and may be
	signed by yourself or by a certificate authority, from a file. To import a public
	certificate (which contains your public key and some information about your MIX or
	organisation and the signer) you always need the corresponding private certificate.
 </LI>
  <LI><B>Export</B><BR>
      The export button is used to save either the public (.cer) oder both the private
	  and the public part (.pfx) of a certificate. If you want to give a certificate
	  to a certificate authority for signing or to another mix for building a connection,
	  you always have to export the public certificate only. But remind this: NEVER give
	  your private certificates away!
   </LI>
  <LI><B>Remove</B><BR>
      Deletes the certificate. Please make sure you either have a backup of the certificate
	  of you really don't need it any more.
  </LI>
  <LI><B>Create</B><BR>
      Creates a new DSA certificate. You may enter a validity and a password. Please
	  note that the validity might be changed by the signer of your certificate at his will.
	  The creation process itself may take some seconds.
  </LI>
  <LI><B>Change Password</B><BR>
      Creates, deletes or changes the password as you like.
  </LI>
</UL>

<h3>Mix Location and Own Mix Certificate</h3>
In the text fields, you should enter information about the location of your mix server.
	By creating the MIX certificate, you proof that this information is correct.

<h3>Operator and Operator Certificate</h3>
These fields contain information about the mix operator, that means you or your organisation.
