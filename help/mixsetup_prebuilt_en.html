<h2>Using prebuilt binaries</h2>
Normally you will use prebuilt binaries to get a MIX system running.
The advantage will be that you do not have to compile everything manually. But you should keep
in mind that you trust the provider of the binary files - in this case the AN.ON team. Under 'hard'
security measures you should prefer to compile the everything yourself from the sources.<br></br>
For detailed information about compilation please refer to:


	<blockquote>

	</blockquote>
	
If you're using either Debian GNU/Linux or Novell SuSE Linux we recommend you to use the
prebuilt packages for your distribution. This has the advantage, that if you want to 
uninstall the program this will work much more convenient without any manual interaction 
in the file system.
<br></br>
Else you have to choose the generic precompiled binaries.
