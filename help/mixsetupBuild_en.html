<h2>Using a self-compiled MIX executable on Linux/UNIX</h2>
If you use precompiled binaries to run your MIX, you should keep in mind that you have to
trust the provider of the binary files -in this case the
AN.ON team - not to have evilly modified the sources. By compiling the server by your own
and controlling the sources you can ensure, to a certain extent, that no backdoors are hidden
in the program. Of course you may also
have reason to trust the sources given on our official website, because other users could have
checked and used it before, this is up to you. This manual will show you how to do the
compilation on Linux/UNIX systems.

Before you download the source code and the libraries, it is recommended to create
a new user account for the MIX server:
	<blockquote>
		<code>
			su<br></br>
			useradd -d /home/mix -m -G users mix<br></br>
			passwd mix<br></br>
			exit<br></br>
			su mix<br></br>
			cd ~
		</code>
	</blockquote>

Then proceed with the following steps:
