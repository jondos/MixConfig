<h2>General introduction to AN.ON MIX Servers</h2>

The AN.ON anonymity service is based on so called MIX cascades: A cascade consists of several
	consecutive single MIX servers (a first MIX, zero or more middle MIXes and a last MIX) and one
	terminating web-proxy. For a working MIX cascade at least two MIXes and the web-proxy are
	needed. Each MIX opens a port where users (in case of the first MIX) or the previous MIX
	(in case of a middle or last MIX) may connect to. The users send their web requests to the
	first MIX that passes them on to the next one and so on until they have reached the last
	mix and the web proxy, respective. The web response takes the same way back. As many users
	send messages at the same time, and as the packets are encrypted for each mix, no one,
	even the MIXes theirselves, know which user requests which information. Only if the
	operators of all MIXes work together, the interests of a user are identified. This provides a
	high level of anonymity.

<p>The AN.ON network provides information about presently working MIX cascades, the number of
connected users on a cascade and the amount of data they send. This is useful, as it gives the
users the possibility to find active cacades to connect to and information about their relative
anonymity. This information is distributed to the user clients by components called
<em><a name="infoservice">InfoService</a></em> that collect the data from the MIXes and act as a distributed
information database.</p>


<h3>What is this document about?</h3>

What you're reading right now is about how to run an AN.ON MIX as an anonymity provider,
in the following called <em> Operator </em>.


<h3>What this document is not about</h3>
It's explicitly not an introduction or documentation about how to use the AN.ON service just
as a user or with a client, respective. If you're seeking just for how to use the client
you're wrong here. For information about the client program called JAP, please refer to the
<a href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/fragen/index_en.html">Questions regarding JAP</a>
or to the
<a href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/help/index_en.html">JAP help section</a>.


<p>If you want to participate in the further development you're also wrong here.
	You find detailed information about all development topics on the
<a href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/develop/sources_en.html">AN.ON developer sites</a>.
There is also information about the
