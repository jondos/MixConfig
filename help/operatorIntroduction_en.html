<h2>General introduction to AN.ON MIX Servers</h2>

<p>The AN.ON anonymity service is based on so called MIX cascades: A cascade consists of several
	consecutive single MIX servers (a first, zero or more middle MIXes and a last MIX) and one
	terminating web-proxy. For a working MIX cascade at least two MIXes and the web-proxy are
	needed. Each MIX opens a port where users (in case of the first MIX) or the previous MIX
	(in case of a middle or last MIX) may connect to. The users send their web requests to the
	first mix that passes them on to the next one and so on until they have reached the last
	mix and the web proxy, respective. The web response takes the same way back. As many user
	do this at the same time, and the packets are encrypted for each mix, no one, even the
	MIXes itself, can link the requested information to the user. Only if the operators
	of all MIXes work together, the interests of a user are identified. This provides a
	high level of anonymity.</p>

The AN.ON network provides information about presently working MIX cascades, the number of
connected users on a cascade and the amount of data they send. This is useful, as it gives the
users the possibility to find active cacades to connect to and information about their relative
anonymity. This information is distributed to the user clients by components called InfoService
that collect the data from the MIXes and acts as a distributed information database.

<h3>What is this document about?</h3>

Since the configuration of a MIX server has become more and more difficult and too complex to
be maintained by hand, we developed a configuration tool called <i>MixConfig</i>. It is both a
tool for creating the XML file that is later used by your MIX server, and a certificate
management tool for the server's cryptographic keys. MixConfig is a Java application which
will run on all Java Runtime Environments since 1.1.8 and on Microsoft JView.


<h3>What this document is not about</h3>

What you're reading right now is just about how to run a MIX as a provider in the MIX network.
It's explicitly not an introduction or documentation about how to use the AN.ON service just
as a user. If you're seeking just for how to use the client you're wrong here. For information
about the client program called JAP, please refer to the
<a href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/fragen/index_en.html">Questions regarding JAP</a>
or to the
<a href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/help/index_en.html">JAP help section</a>.

If you are seeking for information about the source code of the project or you even want to
participate in the further development you're also wrong here. You find detailed information
about all development topics on the
<a href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/develop/sources_en.html">AN.ON developer sites</a>.
There is also information about

and the <a href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/develop/ide_en.html">Development Environment</a>
