<h2>Responsibilities of MIX Operators</h2>

This text explains what a cascade is and how to get your MIX into one.

<h3>Cascade architectures (static or dynamic)</h3>

In order to be able to forward and anonymize user web traffic, each MIX server must be
	part of exactly one MIX cascade. The interconnection between the MIXes is
	either static or dynamic. In a <em><a name="staticCascades">static cascade</a></em> each MIX
	is configured to listen on a certain port for incoming data from it's previous MIX (or the JAP
	clients in case of being the first MIX). On the other hand, each MIX has to know how to connect
	to the following MIX (or the web-proxy in case of being the last MIX). So the host name and the
	port of the following MIX are needed. You get them from the next MIX' Operator, for example
	by e-mail.

<p>In a <em><a name="dynamicCascades">dynamic cascade</a></em> (that is not fully functional yet)
	the MIXes have no static configuration, but  may get connection information about their next
	MIX from the <a href="operatorIntroduction_en.html#infoservice">InfoService</a>.
	Operators of last MIXes construct a cascade by choosing currently unconnected "free"
	MIXes and the chosen MIXes, together with the last MIX, will connect automatically when they
	get the approriate command from the
	<a href="operatorIntroduction_en.html#infoservice">InfoService</a>.
	Of course, all messages are cryptographically signed, so no one will be able to fool
	the system.</p>

<h3>Planning a cascade</h3>

Initially it has to be clear with whom else and how a MIX cascade will be set up. First it's
important to have fast data interconnections between the partners of a cascade. Planning a whole
cascade by your own, you will later or earlier need adequate partners who also run MIX servers.
If you are cannot find others or you maybe just need one more participant, you can write us an
<a href="mailto:jap@inf.tu-dresden.de">email</a>. We will try to find other willing Operators with
similar interests or we will, ourselves, run a server. In any case it's necessary that the partners
of a cascade coordinate with each other so that finally a working cascade can be set up properly.
