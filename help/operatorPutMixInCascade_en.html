<h2>Responsibilities of MIX Operators</h2>

This text explains what a cascade is and how to get your MIX into one.

<h3>Cascade architectures (static or dynamic)</h3>

<p>In order to be able to forward and anonymize user web traffic, each MIX server must be
	part of exactly one MIX cascade. The interconnection between the MIXes is
	either static or dynamic. In a <a name="staticCascades">static cascade</a> each MIX is configured to listen on a certain port for
incoming data from it's previous MIX (or the JAP clients in case of being the first MIX). On the
other hand each MIX has to know how to connect to the following MIX (or the web-proxy in case of
being the last MIX). So the host name and the port of the following MIX are needed. You get
them for the next MIX' operator.</p>

In a <a name="dynamicCascades">dynamic cascade</a> (that is not fully functional yet) the MIXes have no
static configuration, but  may get connection information about their next mix from the InfoService.
Operators of last MIXes construct a cascade from not connected "free" MIXes, and the MIXes
will connect automatically when they get the approriate command from the InfoService. Of course,
all messages are cryptographically signed, so no one will be able to disturb the system.

<h3>Planning a cascade</h3>

Initially it has to be clear with whom else and how a MIX cascade will be set up. First it's
important to have fast data interconnections between the partners of a cascade. Planning a whole
cascade by your own, you will later or earlier need adequate partners who also run MIX servers.
If you are cannot find others or you maybe just need one more participant, you can write us an
<a href="mailto:jap@inf.tu-dresden.de">email</a>. We will try to find other willing providers with
similar interests or we will ourself run a server. In any case it's necessary that the partners
of a cascade coordinate with each other so that finally a working cascade can be set up properly.
