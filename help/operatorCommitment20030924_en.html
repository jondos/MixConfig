<H2>Agreement for Mix Operators</H2>
<P>Version: 24. September 2003 (<a href="operatorCommitment20030924_en.txt">text file for signature</a>) </P>
<P>This agreement aims at ensuring resp. increasing the trustworthiness of the anonymity
	service. To reach this goal, the operators have to take technical and organisational
	precautions for a high degree of privacy and security.</P>

<P>The signatory operates an anonymity host (in the following: mix). Together with other
	mixes, it forms a sequence called mix cascade. A cascade consists of a first mix, a
	last mix, and optionally several middle mixes. In particular, the nature of cascades
	implies that each mix has at most one predecessor-mix and one successor-mix. Mixes are
	connected, e.g., over the Internet.</P>

<h3>Agreement of the Operator</h3>

<P>With respect to the operation of the mix, the operator ensures the following:</P>

<UL>
<LI>The mix operator is bound to the provisions of law.</LI>

<LI>Neither log files containing information of the anonymised connections nor the internal
	states (e.g., the permutation of messages, session keys) are created or stored.</LI>
<LI>Exchange and forwarding of data between the mixes is restricted to what is required by
	the communication protocol specified in the mix software. The mix software is operated
	only in the way described in the specification.</LI>
<LI>The operator prevents unauthorised access to the hardware used for the mix. Physical
	access to the hardware is restricted by constructional, infrastructural, and
	organisational means to the persons required for the operation. Using authentication
	mechanisms (e.g., password protection, possibly biometrics), it is ensured that
	authorised persons can only access data that they have right to access. Administrative
	network access to the mix &#8722; if necessary &#8722; makes use of encrypted connections (
	e.g., SSH).</LI>
<LI>The operator ensures that staff for system administration has the skills, reliability,
	and time necessary for fulfilling their tasks.</LI>
<LI>The hardware and software is configured and maintained according to the state of the
	art of security and privacy, i.e., in particular spying on data by third parties (e.g.,
	by means of computer viruses, Trojan horses) is prevented. Known security leaks are
	fixed as soon as possible.</LI>
<LI>The signatory agrees that the fulfilment of these agreements can be verified by an
	independent privacy protection control organisation at any time even without concrete
	reason.</LI>
</UL>
