<h2>General Panel</h2>
This panel contains some general options. 

<h3>General Settings</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Mix type</b><br>
    The mix type defines in which place in the cascade your mix will be
    located. A cascade consists of at least a first and a last mix, but may
    contain additional middle mixes. <em>If you choose your mix to become a
    last mix, please be aware of the fact that you are the first one to be
    contacted by law encforcement in case of misuse done by users of the
    service</em>. As a last mix you will also have to install a <a
    href="mixconfig.OtherMixPanel_en.html">cache proxy</a>. </li>
  <li><b>Mix configuration</b><br>
    You may choose between two configuration types: static and dynamic. In a
    <em>static</em> configuration, you have to send your certificates and IP
    address to and receive the same information from your neighbour mixes
    before you can start your mix. If you choose <em>dynamic</em>, this
    information is automatically transfered by the Info Service network to each
    mix in the cascade and you have very little communication effort. The
    disadvantage of this concept is, that, except for a last mix, you also have
    very little influence which cascade your mix is assigned to (only minimum
    length of cascade and position in the cascade). <em>Please note that this
    is an experimental feature that won't work in most cases!</em> </li>
  <li><b>Allow dynamic fallback</b><br>
    This is only available in static configurations and allows for a temporary
    dynamic configuration if one or more mixes in the statically defined
    cascade are not available for some time. <em>Please note that this is an
    experimental feature that won't work in most cases!</em> </li>
  <li><b>Cascade name</b><br>
    Dependend on the type of configuration, the first or the last mix has to
    define a human-readable name of the whole cascade. 
    <p><strong>Ignore own short name:</strong> Activate this checkbox if you
    would like to let the cascade name get set by the first mix operator. This
    is not recommended. Better let the cascade name be automatically generated
    with the <a href="mixconfig.OwnCertificatesPanel_en.html">mix or operator
    short name from your certificates</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Info Service</h3>

<p>These fields contain the connection information that is needed to reach an
InfoSerivce. The Info Service is not important to set up the cascade, but it
tells the JAP users that this cascade exists and gives them additional
information about it (length, number of users, mix organisations, mix
locations). If no Info Service reachable, it is not possible to use a dynamic
mix configuration as the needed information cannot be sent or received to/from
the mixes.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Host name</b><br>
    Either an IP address or a DNS name. </li>
  <li><b>Port</b><br>
    The port on which the Info Service is reachable. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Listener Interfaces</h3>

<p>The listener interfaces are needed to tell the mix on which ports it should
listen to connection requests from JAP users or a previous mix. For each
listener interface you may specify the transport protocol, host name, port and
visibility. You may specify as many listeners as you want.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Transport protocol</b><br>
    In almost all cases, TCP + RAW should do the thing. If you really need to
    use the UNIX domain sockets, you should know what you are doing... </li>
  <li><b>Host name</b><br>
    Please enter the IP address of your mix. </li>
  <li><b>Port</b><br>
    The port on which your mix is listening. We suggest you to create listeners
    on the ports 80, 443 and 6544. Please note that in UNIX/Linux systems, you
    must start the mix as <i>root</i> user to bind it to ports lower that 1024.
  </li>
  <li><b>Visibility</b><br>
    If your mix is not connected directly to the internet but is behind a
    router in a local area network (LAN), the internal IP address of the LAN
    differs from the external IP address your mix is visible from the internet.
    In this case, you will have to specify two listener interfaces for each
    port you are listening to: one virtual interface, that contains the host
    name visible from the internet, and one hidden interface, that contains the
    internal host name. The virtual host name will be transfered to the JAP
    users by the Info Service.<br>
    If your mix is behind a NAT gateway, you may also need to define port
    forwarding for the mix listener ports on your router. Please consult the
    router manual for further details. </li>
</ul>
