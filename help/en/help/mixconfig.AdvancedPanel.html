<h3>Logging</h3>

<p>The Mix log contains debug messages that may help you and the developers for
recognizing and fixing errors.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Log disabled</b><br>
    Do not log any messages. NOT recommended. </li>
  <li><b>Log to console</b><br>
    Log everything to the current console. </li>
  <li><b>Log to directory</b><br>
    <strong>Recommended option.</strong> Please enter a directory where the log
    file (which is named <code>messages</code>) should be stored. Most people
    will enter <code>/home/mix/Mixproxy</code> here. </li>
  <li><b>Log to syslog</b><br>
    If you have a running syslog daemon, you may use this option. Please not
    that then, only the messages in the current syslog log level will be
    printed. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Encrypted Log Certificate</h3>

<p>You will only need this if you have something to hide in your logs, e.g.
crime detection data. You do not need it for normal debug logs. Just leave this
alone if you do not need it.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>User name on execution</b> <br>
    <strong>Recommended:</strong> For security reasons, you may start the Mix
    as another user. Then your server will be protected from attackers that
    might hack your Mix. For example, you may type the value
    <strong>mix</strong> into this field. Then the Mix will start with the
    rights of the the user <code>mix</code>. This option does only work if you
    start the Mix as the root user. </li>
  <li><b>Max. number of FDs</b><br>
    This might be important if you are running a first Mix and have to handle a
    lot of users (more than thousand). Then you should allow enough system file
    descriptors for incoming connections. 
    <p><strong>Recommended value: 4096</strong> </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Max. number of users</b><br>
    Limits the number of users that may use a cascade. This option currently
    only has an effect if you are a first Mix. (In the future, however, the
    first Mix may respect a user limit set by other Mixes in the cascade)</li>
  <li><b>Run as daemon</b><br>
    <strong>Recommended:</strong> You will need the Mix to run as daemon, so
    that the process does not stop when you close your login shell. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Traffic Shaping</h3>

<p>These options do only have an effect if you have compiled your mix with the
option <code>--enable-user-bandwidth-limitation</code>. They limit the users
speed and latency.</p>
