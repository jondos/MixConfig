<h2>Responsibilities of MIX Operators</h2>

Due to the inherent insecurity of the Internet, all sent and received messages should be signed
cryptographically.
<h3>MIX certificates</h3>

In the process of configuring your MIX with the MixConfig tool, you will create a cryptographic
certificate that identifies your MIX and enables it to sign messages. This certificate must
be sent to the operators of your neighbouring MIXes, and you must receive their certificates
to get the MIXes connected. In the case of
<a href="operatorResponsibilities_en.html#dynamicCascades">dynamic cascades</a>

the certificate distribution is automatically done by the InfoService (but this is not fully
functional yet). In a
<a href="operatorResponsibilities_en.html#dynamicCascades">static configuration</a>

,
you will have to exchange the certificates by email or other means with the neighbouring
operators.
<h3>Trust</h3>

<p>Certificates and keys itself don't provide communication security, as anyone who has a computer
is able to create them. Therefore, so-called <i>certificate infrastructures</i>
exist, where trusted
authorities sign the certificates and keys of people or organisations that have proven their
identity and the ownership of the certificate/key to them. Each MIX operator has to decide
which authorities he will trust. If you operate a first mix, its certificate must be trusted by
the JAP users as well. They need to, like in browsers, have the certificate of the authority
that signed your certificate installed. At the moment, the JAP-Team is the only trusted authority,
and its certificate is included in the MixConfig tool, the MIX code, the JAP client and the
InfoService. But soon you will be able to add or remove trusted authorities from/to the MIX
configuration. </p>

Certificates and keys are uniquely identified by their hash values, too. If you get a
certificate from someone that is not signed by an authority you trust in, you can still verify
if it is really his/her certificate by comparing the SHA1/MD5 fingerprint with the fingerprint
he/she will tell you. This is, for example, the SHA1 fingerprint of the JAP-Team certificate:
<blockquote>
4D CF 81 F5 92 4B 11 19 6B 44 2A CD 53 E2 46 E1 0D 9A 16 F6
</blockquote>

<h3>Secure communication with the JAP-Team</h3>
The best way to contact us is by <a href="mailto:jap@inf.tu-dresden.de">email</a>
There is no need to encrypt messages since we will not exchange any secret information.
In fact it is better not to encrypt emails in this context but only to sign them, since
signed emails will provide some transparency and reassurance in case of doubt.
Here is the source of our PGP key and it's fingerprint (this key is only fo email
communication and has nothing to do with the MIX network):
<blockquote>
  <code>
    <li><a href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/jappgp.asc">http://anon-inf.tu-dresden.de/jappgp.asc</a></li>
    <li><b>B965 99E4 05EB 4202 895C 27DC D022 60C9 73EE 1DD1</b></li>
  </code>
</blockquote>
If you do not know how to sign or how to check the signature of digital documents with
PGP/GPG, you will find a short manual
<a href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/pgp/sigtest_en.html">here</a>.

<p>
If you don't trust this document itself you should confirm the key's fingerprint by some other
means, e.g. calling us by phone. If you simply send us your public PGP or GPG key in an
unsecured way (e.g. email), we will also not trust it until it has been confirmed by some other
means, like a phone call, or a signature by an authority we trust in.</p>
