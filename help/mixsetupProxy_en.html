<h2>Installing the web-proxy for a last MIX</h2>

A last MIX server is unique in the way that it's not connected to a next MIX server
but to a web-proxy. There are several web proxy servers a MIX can work with.
We recommend using Squid. For further information visit it's website at:

	<blockquote>
		<a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/">http://www.squid-cache.org/</a>
	</blockquote>

<p>In most Linux distributions, for example in Novell SuSE Linux or Debian GNU/Linux,
you can use your package management system to get binaries of Squid. Both systems
ship it - if not in the standard installation than you can get it either from
your installation media or online from a mirror.
Of course you may also compile it manually. Check on the quoted Squid website
	for more information.</p>
Here is an exemplary configuration file for Squid that will fit for most scenarios:
