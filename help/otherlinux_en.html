<h2>Using precompiled binaries</h2>

If you do not want to compile the sources manually you can also download the precompiled binaries. 
You can always find the most up to date versions at:

	<blockquote>
			<a href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/develop/aktversions_en.html">
			http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/develop/aktversions_en.html</a>
	</blockquote>
		

There are - grouped by the components - nightly binary builds of the CVS source code in .tgz format. 
You do not need any compilation steps. What has to be installed are several libraries. 
For example the MIX server (aka proxytest) requires:

	<blockquote>
		<a href="http://www.openssl.org/">
			OpenSSL for cryptographic functions</a> 			
			<br></br>
		<a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/index.html">
			Xerces-C++ for XML functions</a> 
	</blockquote>


At least these two libraries have to be installed on your system so that the MIX server can work properly. 
At best you use the package management tool of your system to install them. If you need additional information
please see at the quoted websites above.<br></br>
The MIX server precompiled binaries are just distributed for Linux / Unix systems. For reasons of security and stability but also because it has not been developed and most tested on this platform we recommended very much this system for running MIX.<br></br>
If you want to run MIX using a Windows system you need to compile it by your own. You will need either the Borland <b>C++ Builder X</b> or a <b>Microsoft C++</b> compiler in at least version 2003 (Visual Studio .Net). 
Both compilers are available for no fees. For additional information please refer our developer manual at:
	
	<blockquote>

			http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/develop/index_en.html</a>			
	</blockquote>


Before you get the binaries some preliminaries are recommended to be done. 
The MIX server and all other needed components should be run using it's own user account. 
To create a new user account you need to be logged in as root.

	<blockquote>
		<code>
			su root<br></br>
			useradd -d /home/mix -m -G users mix<br></br>
			passwd mix<br></br>
			exit<br></br>
			su mix<br></br>
			cd ~
		</code>
	</blockquote>
		
Download the binary package of the MIX server now from the above quoted website and save it in the mix folder.  
If you have no X Window system installed or you prefer the command line you can use wget which is normally 
installed by default on many Linux / Unix systems. Just change into into the mix folder and execute from 
command line:
	
	<blockquote>
			<code>
			wget http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/develop/mix.tgz
			</code>
	</blockquote>

Unpack the the archive now with:

	<blockquote>
			<code>
			tar xfvz mix.tgz
			</code>
	</blockquote>	

The unpacked <b>./mix </b> file is the MIX server. 
You just cannot start it because there is no XML configuration file yet. Please see the <b>MixConfig Tool</b>
documentation how to generate a configuration fitting your needs.
