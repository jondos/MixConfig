<H2>Own Certificates Panel</H2>
      <P>   This panel contains your private mix certificates. These certificates are used to sign information sent by your mix. Without them, no one will trust your mix' messages and no one will be able to connect to your mix. To prove that you are trustworthy, you will also have to let an accepted certificate authority, like the <em>JAP Team</em> (jap@inf.tu-dresden.de), sign your certificates. </P>

	<P>If you want to connect to other mixes in a cascade, and other mixes in the cascade should be able to connect to you, you will have to send your public certificates to those neighbour mixes. If you do this, please verify if the other mixes have received the right certificates by comparing your certificates' hash values with the hash values of the certificates your communication partners have received.</P>

<P>It is recommended to protect your private certificates with a password.</P>

<P><B>General Certificate Options</B></P>
<UL>
  <LI><B>Import</B><BR>
	This option allows you to import private certificates that contain both your private key for signing and the corresponding public key for verifying your signatures, or a public certificate that fits to your private one and may be signed by yourself or by a certificate authority, from a file. To import a public certificate (which contains your public key and some information about your mix or organisation and the signer) you always need the corresponding private certificate.
 </LI>
  <LI><B>Export</B><BR>
      The export button is used to save either the public (.cer) oder both the private and the public part (.pfx) of a certificate. If you want to give a certificate to a certificate authority for signing or to another mix for building a connection, you always have to export the public certificate only. But remind this: NEVER give your private certificates away!
   </LI>
  <LI><B>Remove</B><BR>
      Deletes the certificate. Please make sure you either have a backup of the certificate of you really don't need it any more.
  </LI>
  <LI><B>Create</B><BR>
      Creates a new DSA certificate. You may enter a validity and a password. Please note that the validity might be changed by the signer of your certificate at his will. The creation process itself may take some seconds.
  </LI>
  <LI><B>Change Password</B><BR>
      Creates, deletes or changes the password as you like.
  </LI>
</UL>

<B>Mix Location and Own Mix Certificate</B>
<P>In the text fields, you should enter information about the location of your mix server. By creating

<P><B>Operator and Operator Certificate</B></P>
<P>These fields contain information about the mix operator, that means you or your organisation.
