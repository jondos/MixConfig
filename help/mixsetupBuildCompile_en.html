<h2>Using a self-compiled Mix executable on Linux/UNIX</h2>
If you really want to compile the sources by yourself, perhaps the best way would be
to use the <a href="adminscripts/manual_en.html">admin scripts</a>.
If you do not want this, please follow these instructions:

<h3>Compiling the sources</h3>

Fisrt, go into the source directory:
<blockquote>
	<code>cd proxytest</code>
</blockquote>

There are several configuration options available to adapt the source configuration
to you system. For detailed help run
<blockquote>
	<code>./configure --help</code>
</blockquote>

Now run the configure command:

<blockquote>
	<code>./configure [you may use one or more options here]</code>
</blockquote>

The output will be something like
<blockquote>
	<pre>
<code>
checking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c
checking whether build environment is sane... yes
checking for gawk... no
checking for mawk... mawk
...
checking for OpenSSL directory... (system)
checking for dom/DOM.hpp... yes
Xerces-C includes found
XercesC-Lib found
configure: creating ./config.status
config.status: creating Makefile
config.status: creating popt/Makefile
config.status: creating xml/Makefile
config.status: creating aes/Makefile
config.status: creating trio/Makefile
config.status: creating config.h
config.status: executing depfiles commands </code></pre>
</blockquote>
If configure didn't completely run through, you can check the config.log file for
errors (e.g. using <code>less config.log</code>). Toward the end of that file you
may find a clue as to what went wrong. Look for a line that contains the error message
that you got from configure. Like this one:
<blockquote>
	<code>configure:5328: error: Xerces-C Lib NOT found - please use --with-xml-lib</code>
</blockquote>
<p>Above this error message you will find the test that caused the error and possibly
a more detailed error message.</p>

If configure didn't show any errors, you are ready to compile. Type

	<blockquote>
			<code>make</code>
	</blockquote>

You should now have an executable file called 'mix' in this directory.
It is the Mix server component.

Do a quick test to see if it starts:

	<blockquote>
		<code>./mix -?</code>
	</blockquote>

<p>This should list a short description of the command line options.</p>

Now Start it for testing using a shipped configuration with:
	<blockquote>
		<code>
			./mix config=./documentation/SampleConfiguration/FirstMix.xml
		</code>
	</blockquote>
You should see something like this
<blockquote>
<pre>
<code>

</blockquote>

The mix will look for the next mix, but there is none, of course.
Shut it down by pressing <code>CTRL+C</code>.
Now you can use your own config file in the same way and start your mix.
Be sure to let it run as daemon, as otherwise it will be shut down when
you log out from the console:

	<blockquote>
		<code>
			./mix config=config.xml &amp;
		</code>
	</blockquote>
