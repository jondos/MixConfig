<H2>Live-CD (MixOnCD)</H2>

This is the description of some useful commands for the MixOnCD console.

<h3>Browse, view and edit files</h3>
You may use the <I>norton commander</I> clone <I>midnight commander</I> by typing
<blockquote>
	<CODE>mc</CODE>
</blockquote>
on the command prompt to browse, view and edit files.
As an alternative, you may use the programs <CODE>more</CODE> or <CODE>less</CODE>
to view a file and the editor <CODE>pico</CODE> to edit files. For further
information, please look in the manual pages of those programs by
typing
<blockquote>
	<CODE>man PROGRAM_NAME</CODE>
</blockquote>

<h3>Logging</h3>

If you did a local login to the mix (not via network), you can switch to the
logging console by typing
<blockquote>
	<CODE>CTRL+ALT+F2</CODE>
</blockquote>
Furthermore, the syslog is stored in the file <CODE>/tmp/syslog.out</CODE>
where you can access, manipulate and copy it directly, for example by typing
<blockquote>
	<CODE>pico /tmp/syslog.out</CODE>
</blockquote>


<h3>Access USB device / floppy disk</h3>

If you like to read/move/copy/edit files on the removable medium where you
have put the configuration files, you may do so by changing to the
directory <I>/usbstick</I> by typing
<blockquote>
	<CODE>cd /usbstick</CODE>
</blockquote>

<h3>Update configuration files</h3>

You may update the configuration files and restart the mix without rebooting.
To do this, edit the configuration files on the USB device/floppy disk and type
<blockquote>
	<CODE>/usr/bin/reload_mixconfig</CODE>
</blockquote>

If the configuration files are not writeable (they are on CD, for example) or for
any other reason you don't want to change the originals, you may also edit the
corresponding files in <I>/etc/mix</I>. Those files are automatically generated
during the boot process and are deleted when the mix computer is switched off.
Afterwards, type
<blockquote>
	<CODE>/etc/init.d/mix stop</CODE><BR>
	<CODE>/etc/init.d/mix start</CODE>
</blockquote>

 to restart all mixes.
