 * This is a dialog that executes a given Thread or Runnable if it is shown on screen. It has an optional
 * cancel button. A click on the dialog close button or on the cancel button will interrupt the Thread.
 * The Thread may watch for this event but does not need to. The default behaviour is that, if the Thread
 * is interrupted and has finished, the previous content pane is shown. If it is not interrupted and has
 * finished, the next content pane is shown.
 * <P>Warning: The Thread should not call dispose() on the dialog, as this may lead to a deadlock or
 * an Exception!</P>
