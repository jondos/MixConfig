<h2>Responsibilities of Mix Operators</h2>
You need to know that not every computer that is connected to the internet is
suitable to become a Mix. 

<h3>Choosing the right server</h3>
You will need a computer with a high performance CPU (ideally on a separate
machine) and lots of bandwidth: at least 10 MBit/s are required, or you won't
get many users on your cascade. As the anonymity of a single user correlates
positively with the number of total users on a cascade, that would mean that
the deanonymization of a small user group would be relatively easy. 

<p>As the traffic caused by the Mix could greatly reduce your overall network
performance, and as you could get <a
href="operatorLawEnforcement_en.html">crime detection requests </a> from
individuals, organisations and law enforcement agencies, don't try to run a Mix
in your network if you don't have the authority or permission to do so.</p>

<p>The Mix should also have a stable operating system (we recommend <a
href="http://www.debian.org">Debian </a> or <a
href="http://www.suselinux.com">SuSE </a> Linux) and should be connected to the
internet as long as possible: 365 days a year and 24 hours a day would be
perfect. Otherwise, the users of your cascade might be annoyed and choose
another one, or even another anonymization service. Renting a dedicated server
from a commercial web hoster is not a bad idea for a Mix.</p>
