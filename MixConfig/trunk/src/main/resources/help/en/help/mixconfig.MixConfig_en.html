<h2>The MixConfig Tool</h2>
Since creating a Mix configuration for operating a Mix server is quite a
complex task, we developed a configuration tool called <b>MixConfig</b>. It is
both a tool for creating the XML file that is used later on by your Mix server,
as well as a certificate management tool for the server's cryptographic keys.
MixConfig is a Java application which runs on Java 1.6 and above. The tool can
be downloaded from <a
href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/develop/MixConfig.html">this</a> page or
directly from <a
href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/develop/MixConfig.jar">here</a>. The
MixConfig tool can be started by typing the following command: 

<blockquote>
  <code>java -jar MixConfig.jar</code> </blockquote>
<!-- If you are using Java 1.1 you may additionally need the Swing classes. After 
obtaining these, the tool can be started using

<blockquote>
<code>java -classpath MixConfig.jar:swingall.jar mixconfig.MixConfig<code>
</blockquote> -->
You can query a list of possible options with 

<blockquote>
  <code>java -jar MixConfig.jar --help</code> </blockquote>
<strong>Please note:</strong> This is a graphical tool that you cannot run on
your Mix server. You need a desktop environment (Windows, Mac OS X, X Windows)
for using the tool.<!-- JView command for Java 1.1 -->
<!-- jview /cp MixConfig.jar:swingall.jar mixconfig.MixConfig -->

<H3>Start Screen</H3>

The MixConfig tool has two modes of operation: The <b>wizard</b> mode, where 
you get complete guidance to create the configuration file for your Mix, and 
the <b>expert</b> mode, where you have some more options, but less support. 
(See also <A HREF="menuView_en.html">View menu</A> for further details). If you 
choose one of the following options, the MixConfig tool will start in the 
wizard mode:

<UL>
	<LI> <B>Create new configuration</B><BR>
		Creates a new configuration with default values.
        </LI>
	<LI> <B>Load/Resume existing configuration</B><BR>
		Loads a configuration from a file.
	</LI>
	<!-- <LI> <B>Configure Cascade for existing configuration</B><BR>
		Load a configuration from a file, and jumps directly to the "Configure 
		Cascade" dialog. This does only work if the Mix is dynamic and the last
		Mix in a cascade. (Currently not available)
	</LI> -->
</UL>
