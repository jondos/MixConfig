/**
 * This is a dialog that executes a given Thread or Runnable if it is shown on screen. It has an optional
 * cancel button. A click on the dialog close button or on the cancel button will interrupt the Thread.
 * The Thread may watch for this event but does not need to. The behaviour if the Thread
 * is interrupted (isInterrupted() returns true) and has finished is the same as if a user clicks the
 * cancel button. You may therefore control this behaviour by defining another default button operation
 * for the cancel button and by overwriting the isInterrupted() method of your Thread.
 * If the Thread is not interrupted and has finished, the next content pane is shown. If there is no next
 * content pane, the dialog is closed according to the ON_CLICK button operation. By default, it is disposed.
 * <P>Warning: The Thread should not call dispose() on the dialog, as this may lead to a deadlock or
 * an Exception!</P>
 * @todo Modify the class so that a status bar (0-100%) can be shown, too.
