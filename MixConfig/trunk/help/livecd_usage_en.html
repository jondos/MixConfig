<H2>Live-CD (MixOnCD)</H2>

<B>Browse, view and edit files</B>
<P>You can use the <I>norton commander</I>-clone <I>midnight commander</I> by typing <I>mc</I> on the command prompt to browse, view and edit files. As an alternative, you may use the programs <I>more</I> or <I>less</I> to view a file and the editor <I>pico</I> to edit files. For further information, please look in the manual pages of those programs by typing <I>man PROGRAM_NAME</I>.</P>

<B>Logging</B>
<P> 
If you did a local login to the mix (not via network), you can switch to the logging console by typing <I>CTRL+ALT+F2</I> 
Furthermore, the syslog is stored in the file /tmp/syslog.out where you can access, manipulate and copy it directly.
</P>

<B>Access USB device / floppy disk</B>
<P>If you like to read/move/copy/edit files on the removable medium where you have put the configuration files, you may do so by changing to the directory <I>/usbstick</I> by typing <I>cd /usbstick</I>.</P>

<B>Update configuration files</B>
<P>
You may update the configuration files and restart the mix without rebooting. To do this, edit the configuration files on the USB device/floppy disk and type <I>/usr/bin/reload_mixconfig</I>.
</P>
<P> If the configuration files are not writeable or for any other reason you don't want to change the originals, you may also edit the corresponding files in <I>/etc/mix</I>. Those files are automatically generated during the boot process and are deleted when the mix computer is switched off. Afterwards, type <I>/etc/init.d/mix stop </I> and <I>/etc/init.d/mix start </I> to restart all mixes.
</P>
