<H2>Live-CD (MixOnCD)</H2>

<B>Download and configuration deployment</B>

<P>To use MixOnCD you will have to download the MixOnCD iso-file from 
<A HREF="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/develop/MixOnCD.iso">http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/develop/MixOnCD.iso</A>. Use your favorite CD burning software to write it on a CD. Two modes are available for deploying your configuration file:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Two-session CD with configuration file in second session</B><BR>
  Create a multi-session disc with the iso-file in the first session and put the configuration file created by this
  tool on the second session. 
  </LI>
  <LI><B>Single-session CD with configuration file on a USB device</B><BR>
  Copy your configuration to a USB device, for example a USB stick. Insert the Live-CD, switch off your computer, 
  plug the device into any USB port, and switch power on again. 
  </LI>
</UL>
Your mix will now start automatically, but it may take some minutes to boot.

<P>Please note that, if you deploy more than one configuration file, a separate mix will be started for
each configuration file. Those files may contain different network settings for MixOnCD, but only the settings from
the alphabetically first file are used to initialize MixOnCD.</P>
