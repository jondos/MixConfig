<h2>Compiling from the sources</h2>
There are two possibilities to get a running MIX server on your system. 
Either you can get it compiled by your own or you can use the precompiled 
binaries distributed on our website. This first part will show how to compile 
your own binaries from the source code.<br></br>
One reason why you may want to compile the server by your own directly from the 
sources could be that you want to ensure that no backdoors are hidden in the 
program and you perfectly know what is executed on your machine. On the one hand 
you can check the sources by yourself for backdoors. On the other hand you may 
also trust the code given on our official website because other users have checked 
and used it maybe before. Before you get the source code and the libraries onto 
some preliminaries are recommended to be done. The MIX server and all other needed 
components should be run under it's own account. To create a new user account you 
need to be logged in as root.

	<blockquote>
		<code>
			useradd -d /home/mix -m -G users mix<br></br>
			passwd mix<br></br>
			exit<br></br>
		</code>
	</blockquote>

Than log in as this new '<b>mix</b>' user and proceed through the following steps. We 
will mention if you need to change your login again.

<h3>2.1 How to get the sources</h3>
First of all you will need to get the source code of each component. For purpose of getting 
up to date source code you should always get it from the official AN.ON websites. The first 
quoted URL is the official one registered to the AN.ON project. The second is the host where 
AN.ON is hosted since it's beginning days. This may some day change. 
The first URL will always work.

	<blockquote>
		<a href="http://www.anon-online.de/">http://www.anon-online.de</a>
			<br></br>
		<a href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/">http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de</a>
	</blockquote>
	
On the website you find a section '<i>Developer</i>'. This is the right place to start.
What you also will need for your own compilation are the libraries mentioned on:
	
	<blockquote>
		<a href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/develop/sources_en.html">
		http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/develop/sources_en.html</a>
	</blockquote>
	
Not each component / server needs all libraries. 
Depending on which component you want to use you have to follow the link given at 
each components description on the above mentioned website and download it.
For the MIX server you will need:
	
	<blockquote>
		<a href="http://www.openssl.org/">
		OpenSSL for cryptographic functions</a> 			
			<br></br>
		<a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/index.html">
		Xerces-C++ for XML functions</a> 
	</blockquote>
	
If you go so far that you even want to compile the libraries by your own, please follow 
the given links to the original websites of each library and check for documentation how 
to do this there. This documentation will give you just an explanation how to work with 
precompiled libraries.<br></br>
The normal and most convenient way to get the libraries installed on your system is to 
use the package manager of your distribution. Using SuSE 9.3 this is Yast2. Using Debian 
3.1 this is the text based and even more simple apt-get frontend. If you are not familiar 
with these tools please check your distributions documentation. On both Linux flavors all 
needed libraries are available.

<h4>2.1.1 Code snapshots</h4>
In the developer section you can find some download links which lead to archives in the 
.tgz format which are generated automatically each night from the present CVS sourcecode. 
You can download them with your browser and unpack them to any directory. There are by components:

	<blockquote>
		<a href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/develop/mix.src.tgz">
			http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/develop/mix.src.tgz</a>
				<br></br>
		<a href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/develop/mixconfig.src.tgz">
			http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/develop/mixconfig.src.tgz</a>		
	</blockquote>
	
From the MIX server (aka proxytest) both the present 00.02 and the former 00.01 versions are still provided. 
Just the newer 00.02.xx code tree is still maintained.<br></br>
Download the archive to your home directory. Now unpack the archive. 
Unpacking will automatically generate a directory with same name as the archive. 
For example the following command will unpack the source code into <code>./proxytest</code>

	<blockquote>
		<code>
			tar xzvf proxytest.tgz
		</code>
	</blockquote>
	
<h4>2.1.2 Developer CVS</h4>
Another possibility to get the source code is the CVS server which is used for coordinating 
the development process of AN.ON. There you will find the most up to date version.
Here we assume that you have just a command line version of a Linux CVS client in your console. 
If you prefer to use a graphical client you have to configure it yourself. In the following 
instructions  I presume that you have a bash shell installed. First login as the new creates 
user 'mix'. To download the sources of the MIX server you u have to follow this:
	
	<blockquote>
			<code>
				cd /~<br></br>
				mkdir mixsrc<br></br>
				cd mixsrc<br></br>
				export CVSROOT=":pserver:anonymous@cvs.inf.tu-dresden.de:/home/sk13/cvssource"<br></br>
				cvs checkout proxytest
			</code>
		</blockquote>
		
It may take a minute or two and than you should have the source code in the directory you have 
created before. Having downloaded the code you are ready now to compile the sources and install 
the binaries on your system.<br></br>

<h3>2.2 Compiling the sources</h3>

<h4>2.2.1 Using Debian Sarge</h4>

	<blockquote>
			<code>
				cd proxytest<br></br>
				./configure<br></br>					
				make
			</code>
	</blockquote>
	
There are several configuration options available to adapt the configuration to you system. 
For detailed help run:

	<blockquote>
				<code>
					./configure --help<br></br>
				</code>
	</blockquote>
	
There should now be a binary file called mix be in your folder. 
This is the MIX server component. Start it for testing with using a 
shipped configuration with:
	<blockquote>
		<code>
			./mix config=./documentation/SampleConfiguration/FirstMix.xml
		</code>
	</blockquote>
<h4>2.2.2 Running SuSE 9.3</h4>

On SuSE 9.3 Linux it's absolutely the same as with Debian.
