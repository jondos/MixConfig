<H2>Live-CD (<i>MixOnCD</i>)</H2>

The AN.ON MIX live CD is a runtime environment for mixes. You won't need to install anything
on your harddisk to use it, neither will it write or change any data on your harddisk. Just burn the CD
and boot from it. See <A HREF="mixsetupLiveCD_en.html">Using the Live-CD (<i>MixOnCD</i>)</A>
for further installation details.
