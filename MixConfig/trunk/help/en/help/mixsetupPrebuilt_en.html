<h2>Using prebuilt binaries</h2>
If you're using either Debian GNU/Linux or Novell SuSE Linux as operating system for your Mix,
we recommend you to use the prebuilt packages for your distribution. The advantage is that
installation and updates will work much more convenient without any manual interaction
in the file system and with a compiler. We provide binaries for other systems, too,
but you will have to do some things on the console to get them running.

<p>The Mix server precompiled binaries are just distributed for Linux / UNIX systems.
For reasons of security and stability but also because it has not been developed and
most tested on this platform we recommended very much this system for running a Mix.</p>

If you want to run a Mix using a Windows system you need to compile it by your own.
	You will need either <b>Eclipse</b> or a <b>Microsoft Visual C++ .NET</b>
