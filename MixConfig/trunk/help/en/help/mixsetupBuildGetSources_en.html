<h2>Using a self-compiled Mix executable on Linux/UNIX</h2>
There are several ways to get the Mix source code. You always get up-to-date
sources from the official AN.ON websites: 

<blockquote>
  <a href="http://www.anon-online.de/">http://www.anon-online.de</a> <br>
  <a href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/">http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de</a>
</blockquote>
The first quoted URL is the official one registered to the AN.ON project. The
second is the host where AN.ON is hosted since it's beginning days. This may
some day change. The first URL will always work. On the website you will find a
section '<i>Developer</i>'. This is the right place to start. 

<h3>Developer CVS</h3>
Another possibility to get the source code is the CVS server which is used for
coordinating the development process of AN.ON. There you will find the most up
to date version. We assume that you have just a command line version of a Linux
CVS client in your console. If you prefer to use a graphical client you have to
configure it yourself. In the following instructions I presume that you have a
bash shell installed. First login as the new creates user 'mix'. To download
the sources of the Mix server you u have to follow this: 

<blockquote>
  <code>cd /~<br>
  mkdir mixsrc<br>
  cd mixsrc<br>
  export
  CVSROOT=":pserver:anonymous@cvs.inf.tu-dresden.de:/home/sk13/cvssource"<br>
  cvs checkout proxytest </code> </blockquote>
It may take a minute or two and than you should have the source code in the
directory you have created before. Having downloaded the code you are ready now
to compile the sources and install the binaries on your system. <!--#include virtual="/footer_en.html"-->
