<h2>Certificates</h2>
Due to the inherent insecurity of the Internet, all sent and received messages
in the AN.ON/JonDonym system are signed cryptographically. 

<h3>General information about certificates</h3>

<p>Certificates are digital envelopes for cryptographic key pairs. They contain
a private key, a corresponding public key and information about the owner of
those keys. In the scope of digital signatures, the owner may use his private
key to digitally sign messages. Other people may use the certificate to verify
the public key belongs to the owner of the private key, and may then verify
documents signed by the owner with the public key. The private key must be kept
secret by its owner, as otherwise third parties may sign documents in his
name.</p>

<p>In the scope of Mixes, certificates are important to let the users identify
the Mixes and especially their Operators. This is part of the security model of
the AN.ON / JonDonym service. It prevents arbitrary, possibly malicious people
from running Mixes and enables the users to choose whom they want to trust.</p>

<p><strong>Mix certificates</strong></p>
In the process of configuring your Mix with the MixConfig tool, you will create
a cryptographic <em>Mix certificate</em> that identifies your Mix and enables
it to sign messages. You have to send this certificate to the Operators of your
neighbouring Mixes, and you have to receive and register their certificates in
your configuration to get the Mixes connected. (Please note that an automatic
certificate exchange is in preparation.) 

<p><strong>Operator certificates</strong></p>

<p>The Operators in the AN.ON / JonDonym system may run more than one Mix. For
the purpose of identifying which Mix belongs to which Operator, each Operator
has to create a so-called <em>Operator certificate</em>. This certificate
identifies the Operator as private individual or as organisation. With your
Operator certificate, you may sign as many Mix certificates as you want. </p>

<p><strong>Trust</strong></p>
Certificates and keys itself don't provide communication security, as anyone
who has a computer is able to create them. Therefore, so-called <i>certificate
infrastructures</i> exist: trusted authorities sign the certificates and keys
of people or organisations that have proven their identity and the ownership of
the certificate/key. The AN.ON / JonDonym service supports more than one of
these certification authorities. For example, you may get Operator certificates
signed by the <a href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de">TU Dresden</a>, the <a
href="http://www.jondos.com">JonDos GmbH</a> and the <a
href="http://www.privacyfoundation.de">German Privacy Foundation</a>. Please
not that your Mixes will neither be visible nor usable for clients if you do
not have a valid certificate. 

<p>Certificates and keys are uniquely identifyable by their hash values. Before
doing a signature, certification authorities will therefore ask you to compare
your certificates subject key identifier (SKI) or SHA1/MD5 fingerprint with the
certificate they got from you. If you think that you got a wrong Mix
certificate from another operator, you may also compare its subjekt key
identifier with the one that he/she tells you.</p>

<p><strong>Certification</strong></p>

<p>Only your Operator certificate is certified by certification authorities.
Please export it into a certificaion request file (.p10) and send it to the
authority. You may then take the certified file from the CA and just import it
"over" your current Operator certificate. Done.</p>

<h3>General certificate options</h3>

<p>The certificate panels show you the status and some options to both your Mix
and Operator certificate. As status, you can see an image indicating if a
certificate may be verified against one of the root certificates of valid
certificate authorities. You also get the subject key identifier (SKI) of each
certificate as copyable character string. You should compare it with the SKIs
of the certificates that your neighbour Operators got from you in case of
connection problems. </p>

<p>If you click on a certificate image, you will get even more detailed
information about the certificate.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Import</b><br>
    This option allows you to import private certificates that contain both
    your private key for signing and the corresponding public key for verifying
    your signatures, or a public certificate that fits to your private one and
    may be signed by yourself or by a certificate authority, from a file. To
    import a public certificate (which contains your public key and some
    information about your Mix or organisation and the signer) you always need
    the corresponding private certificate. </li>
  <li><b>Export</b><br>
    The export button is used to save either the public (.cer) oder both the
    private and the public part (.pfx) of a certificate. If you want to give a
    certificate to a certificate authority for signing or to another mix for
    building a connection, you always have to export the public certificate
    only. But remind this: NEVER give your private (PKCS12) certificates away!
    They contain your secrets keys that must be kept private.</li>
  <li><b>Remove</b><br>
    Deletes the certificate. Please make sure you either have a backup of the
    certificate or that you really don't need it any more. </li>
  <li><b>Create</b><br>
    Creates a new DSA certificate. You may enter a validity and a password. The
    creation process itself may take some seconds. Currently, only certificates
    with the DSA algorithm may be created. Support for RSA and elliptic curves,
    and even for more than one certificate chain are close at hand.</li>
  <li><b>Sign</b> <br>
    This option is only available for your Mix certificate. The Mix certificate
    should always be signed with your Operator certificate. If this is, for
    some reason, not the case, you can sign it by using this button.</li>
  <li><b>(Change) Password</b><br>
    This button allows you to set, remove or change the password fora
    certificate. To delete a password, just let the feals for the new password
    empty. You should choose strong passwords for your certificates, so that an
    unnoticed loss of your certificate data will not endanger the security of
    your Mixes. If others get your certificates, they might fake the connection
    to your Mix and thereby trap users. While this scenario is not very
    probable, it might nevertheless happen if all Operators would be careless
    with their certificates.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mix Location</h3>
In the text fields, you should enter information about the location of your Mix
server. By creating the Mix certificate you state that this information is
correct. 

<h3>Operator</h3>

<p>These fields contain information about the Mix Operator, that means you or
your organisation. The Operator certificate containing this information must be
signed by a certificate authority to proof that it is correct. You may only use
one Operator certificate at a time for all you Mixes. Just export and import it
into an other configuration. <!--#include virtual="/footer_en.html"-->
