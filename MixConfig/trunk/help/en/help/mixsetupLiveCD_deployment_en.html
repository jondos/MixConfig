<H2>Live-CD (MixOnCD)</H2>
This chapter covers the precedure to download the CD and put the configuration file that was
created by the MixConfig tool on it.

<h3>Download</h3>

To use MixOnCD you will have to download the MixOnCD iso file from
<a href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/develop/MixOnCD.iso.bz2">http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/develop/MixOnCD.iso.bz2</A>. Use your favorite CD burning software to write it on a CD. Two modes are available for deploying your configuration file:

<h3>Configuration deployment</h3>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Single-session CD with configuration file on USB device or floppy disk</B><BR>
  Copy your configuration to a USB device, for example a USB stick, or to a floppy disk. Insert the Live-CD, switch off your computer, plug the device into any USB port respective the disk into the slot, and switch power on again. If you do not choose explicitely to use the USB device/disk for logging purposes, you can put it off after booting.
  </LI>
  <LI><B>Two-session CD with configuration file in second session</B><BR>
  Create a multi-session disc with the iso-file in the first session and put the configuration file created by this
  tool on the second session. Do not forget to close the CD afterwards with the corresponding option in you burning tool!
  <I>Please note that this feature is currently experimental and will fail in most cases.</I>
  </LI>
</UL>
Your mix will now start automatically, but it may take some minutes to boot.

<P>Please note that, if you deploy more than one configuration file, a separate mix will be started for
each configuration file. Those files may contain different network settings for MixOnCD, but only the settings from
the alphabetically first file are used to initialize MixOnCD. Furthermore, please be sure not to use the same listener port for two or more of the mixes, as each mix needs to have its own port exclusively.</P>
