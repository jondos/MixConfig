<h2>Using precompiled binaries</h2>

If you do not want to compile the sources manually you can also download the precompiled binaries.
You can always find the most up to date versions at:

	<blockquote>
			<a href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/develop/aktversions_en.html">
			http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/develop/aktversions_en.html</a>
	</blockquote>


There are - grouped by the components - nightly binary builds of the CVS source code in .tgz format.
You do not need any compilation steps. What has to be installed are several libraries.
The Mix server (aka proxytest) requires:

	<blockquote>
		<a href="http://www.openssl.org/">
			OpenSSL for cryptographic functions</a>
			<br></br>
		<a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/index.html">
			Xerces-C++ for XML functions</a>
	</blockquote>


At best you use the package management tool of your system to install them. If you need additional information
please see at the quoted websites above.<br></br>


Before you get the binaries some preliminaries are recommended to be done.
The Mix server and all other needed components should be run using it's own user account.
To create a new user account you need to be logged in as root.
<blockquote>
<pre>
<code>
		su
		useradd -d /home/mix -m -G users mix
		passwd mix
		exit
		su mix
		cd ~
</code>
</pre>
</blockquote>
Download the binary package of the Mix server now from the above quoted website and save it in the mix folder.
If you have no X Window system installed or you prefer the command line you can use wget which is normally
installed by default on many Linux / Unix systems. Just change into into the mix folder and execute from
command line:

	<blockquote>
			<code>wget http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/develop/mix.tgz</code>
	</blockquote>

Unpack the the archive now with:

	<blockquote>
			<code>tar xfvz mix.tgz</code>
	</blockquote>

The unpacked <code>./mix </code> file is the Mix server.
You just cannot start it because there is no XML configuration file yet. Please see the <b>MixConfig Tool</b>
documentation how to generate a configuration fitting your needs.
