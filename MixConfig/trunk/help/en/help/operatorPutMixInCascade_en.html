<h2>Responsibilities of Mix Operators</h2>
This text explains what a cascade is and how to get your Mix into one. 

<h3>Cascade architectures (static or dynamic)</h3>
In order to be able to forward and anonymize user web traffic, each Mix server
must be part of exactly one Mix cascade. The interconnection between the Mixes
is either static or dynamic. In a <em><a name="staticCascades">static
cascade</a></em> each Mix is configured to listen on a certain port for
incoming data from it's previous Mix (or the JAP clients in case of being the
first Mix). On the other hand, each Mix has to know how to connect to the
following Mix (or the web-proxy in case of being the last Mix). So the host
name and the port of the following Mix are needed. You get them from the next
Mix' Operator, for example by e-mail. 

<p>In a <em><a name="dynamicCascades">dynamic cascade</a></em> (that feature is
not available yet but in preparation) the Mixes have no static configuration,
but may automatically get their connection information about their next Mix
from the <a href="operatorIntroduction_en.html#infoservice">InfoService</a>.</p>

<h3>Planning a cascade</h3>
Initially it has to be clear with whom else and how a Mix cascade will be set
up. First it's important to have fast data interconnections between the
partners of a cascade. You might want to check the connections by ping and
traceroutes (if you do not know what this is, it might be better that you do
not run a Mix). If you are cannot others any partners or you maybe just need
one more participant, you can write an e-mail to the <a
href="mailto:jap@inf.tu-dresden.de">TU Dresden</a>, to the <a
href="mailto:jondonym_info@jondos.de">JonDos GmbH</a> or to the <a
href="http://www.privacyfoundation.de/kontakt/">German Privacy Foundation</a>.
They will try to find other willing Operators or will, themselves, run a Mix
server. In any case it's necessary that the partners of a cascade coordinate
with each other so that finally a working cascade can be set up properly. <!--#include virtual="/footer_en.html"-->
