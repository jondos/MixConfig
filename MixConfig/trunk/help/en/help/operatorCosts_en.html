<h2>Costs of becoming a Mix Operator</h2>

Before you run your own Mix, you should keep in mind that this is not for free. Although there aren't
any costs for licencing fees for the software and the service itself, running a Mix might be costly for you.
You will need to

<ul>
	<li>buy or hire server hardware (at least one server),</li>
	<li>buy a heavy amount of network traffic each month (several terabytes)</li>
	<li>spend time for configuration and maintenance of your server (several hours per month)</li>
	<li>hire legal advice that helps you in case of misuse of your server (this mostly refers to
		non-german Operators of the last mix in a cascade, as in Germany,
		<a href="operatorLawEnforcement_en.html">we will do this for you</a>) </li>
</ul>

If you think that you can't handle these costs, you should seek our advice.
