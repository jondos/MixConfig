<h2>Costs of becoming a Mix Operator</h2>
Although there aren't any costs for licencing fees for the software and the
service itself, you should keep in mind that operating a Mix server might get
expensive for you. You will need to 
<ul>
  <li>buy or hire server hardware (at least one server, typically between 50
    and 200 Euro per month),</li>
  <li>buy a heavy amount of network traffic each month (from hundreds of
    gigabytes up to some terabytes per month; the typical price per gigabyte
    ranges from 0.02 to 0.25 Euro Cent)</li>
  <li>spend time for configuration and maintenance of your server (several
    hours per month)</li>
  <li>hire legal advice that helps you in case of misuse of your server</li>
</ul>
If you think that you can't handle these costs, you should seek our advice. 

<p>Maybe you would like to take part in the Premium system, where users pay for
traffic. While only a few people are willing to offer Mixes for free, there are
many who would do that if they get hteir traffic paid. Therefore it may take
some time until we can offer you a Premium operator contract.<!--#include virtual="/footer_en.html"-->
