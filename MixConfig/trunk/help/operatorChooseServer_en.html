<h2>Responsibilities of MIX Operators</h2>

You need to know that not every computer that is connected to the internet is
suitable as a MIX.

<h3>Choosing the right server</h3>

You will need a computer with a high performance CPU (ideally on a separate machine)
and a lot of bandwidth: at least 10 MBit/s are required, or you won't get a lot of users
on your cascade, what would mean that the deanonymization of those would be too easy.
As the traffic caused by the MIX could greatly reduce your overall network performance,
don't try to run a MIX in your network if you don't have the authority or permission to
do so.

<p>The MIX should also have a stable operating system (we recommend Debian or SuSE Linux)
	and should be connected to the internet as long as possible, 365 days a year and
	24 hours a day would be perfect. Otherwise, the users of your cascade will be
	annoyed and choose another one or even another anonymization service. Renting a
	dedicated server at a commercial web hoster is not a bad idea for a MIX.</p>
