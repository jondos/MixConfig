<h2>Using a self-compiled Mix executable on Linux/UNIX</h2>

You will need several libraries to compile the Mix server code.

<h3>Installing the libraries</h3>

Precompiled binaries and sources of the needed libraries are available on these
websites:

	<blockquote>
		<a href="http://www.openssl.org/">
		OpenSSL for cryptographic functions</a>
			<br></br>
		<a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/index.html">
		Xerces-C++ for XML functions</a>
	</blockquote>

<p>If you even want to compile the libraries by your own, please follow
the given links to the original websites of each library and check for documentation how
to do this there. This documentation will give you just an explanation how to work with
precompiled libraries.</p>
The most convenient way to get the libraries installed on your system is to
use the package manager of your distribution. Using, for example, SuSE 9.3 this is Yast2, using Debian
3.1 this is the text based and even more simple apt-get frontend. If you are not familiar
with these tools please check your distribution's documentation.
