<h2>Setting up a last MIX server</h2>

A last MIX server is unique in the way that it's not connected to a next MIX server but to a web-proxy.
There are several web-proxy servers a MIX can work with. We recommend for example Squid. For further 
information visit it's website at:
	
	<blockquote>
		<a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/">http://www.squid-cache.org/</a>
	</blockquote>
	
Using Novell SuSE Linux or Debian GNU/Linux you can use your package management system to get binaries
from Squid. Both systems ship it - if not in the standard installation than you can get it either from
your installation media or online from a mirror. <br></br>
For sure you can also compile it manually. Check on the quoted Squid website for more information.
<p></p>
There is an exemplary configuration file on this website which will fit for most scenarios.
