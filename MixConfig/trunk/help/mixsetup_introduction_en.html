<h2>General introduction to MIX servers</h2>

<h3>1. What is it all about?</h3>

The AN.ON anonymity service is based on so called MIX cascades. A cascade consists of several consecutive single
MIX servers and one terminatory web-proxy. For a working MIX cascade at least two MIXES and a web-proxy are needed.
Optionally more than these two are possible. Due to historic reasons in the AN.ON project, the MIX server is written
in C++ and called ProxyTest.<br></br>
The AN.ON network is based on information about present working MIX cascades and the present connected users. This
information is distributed by a component called InfoService. This is a kind of a control channel for the users and
the servers of a cascade. Because InfoService is written in Java, you will need a Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
1.1.8 or newer.
<br></br>
Since the configuration of a MIX server has become more and more difficult and too complex to be maintained by hand,
we developed a configuration tool called <i>MixConfig</i>. It is both a wizard (a complex one) for creating the XML file
later used by a MIX server and a certificate management tool for the servers cryptographic keys. Also MixConfig is
a Java application. So you will also need a Java Runtime newer than 1.1.8 or for own compilation a JDK newer
than 1.1.8.
<p></p>

<h3>2. What is is not about?</h3>

What you're reading right now is just about how to run a MIX as a provider in the MIX network.
It's explicitly not an introduction or documentation about how to use the AN.ON service just as a user.
If you're seeking just for how to use the client you're wrong here. For information about the client program
called JAP, please refer to the
<a href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/fragen/index_en.html">Questions regarding JAP</a>
or to the
<a href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/help/index_en.html">JAP help section</a>.
<br></br>
If you are seeking for information about the source code of the project or you even want to participate in the further
development you're also wrong here. You find detailed information about all development topics on the
<a href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/develop/sources_en.html">AN.ON developer sites</a>.
There is also additional information about
	<a href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/develop/codingstyle_en.html">general coding styles</a>
and the <a href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/develop/ide_en.html">Development environments</a>

<h3>3. A cascades architecture</h3>

Each MIX server is part of maximal one MIX cascade. The interconnection of the MIXES is either static or dynamic.
Up to now all known cascades are static. Dynamic cascades have been implemented in 2003 and proved to work.
Nevertheles this is at the moment still an experimental feature and under development. In a static cascade each
MIX is configured to listen on a certain port for incoming data from it's previous MIX (or the JAP clients
in case of being first MIX). On the other hand each MIX has to know how to connect to the following MIXes
(or the web-proxy in case of being last MIX). So the host name and the port of the following MIX are needed.
In a dynamic cascade it's planned that a MIX can decide after getting enough information through InfoService
if it wants to act as a first or middle MIX. Just the last MIX with the flow-operated web-proxy is not dynamic.
At the present working implementation the decision is made not by the MIX server itself but by the InfoService.

<h3>4. Planning a cascade</h3>

Initially it has to be clear with whom else and how a MIX cascade will be set up. First it's important to have
fast data interconnections between the partners of a cascade. Planning a whole cascade by your own you will earlier
or later need adequate partners who also run MIX servers. If you are cannot find others or you maybe just need one more
participant, you can write us an email. We will try to find other willing providers with similar interests or we will
ourself run a server. In any case it's necessary that the partners of a cascade coordinate with each another so that
finally a working cascade can be set up properly.

<h3>5. Keys and Trust</h3>

Due to the inherent insecurity of the Internet all sent and received messages should be signed cryptographically.
There is no need to encrypt messages since we will not exchange any secret information. In fact it is better not
to encrypt emails in this context since signed emails will provide some transparency and reassurance in case of doubt.
Here is the source of our PGP key and it's valid fingerprint:

	<blockquote>
		<code>
			<li><a href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/jappgp.asc">http://anon-inf.tu-dresden.de/jappgp.asc</a></li>
			<li><b>B965 99E4 05EB 4202 895C 27DC D022 60C9 73EE 1DD1</b></li>
		</code>
	</blockquote>
	
If you don't trust this document itself you should conrifm the key's fingerprint by some other means, e.g. calling us
by phone. If you simply send us your public PGP or GPG key in an unsecured way (e.g. email) we will also not trust
it until it has been confirmed by some other means, like a phone call.
